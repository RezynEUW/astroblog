Gradient descent is fundamental to training machine learning models. Let's explore how it works.

## The Basics

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent.

Here's a simple implementation in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    m = len(y)
    theta = np.zeros(X.shape[1])
    
    for _ in range(iterations):
        predictions = X @ theta
        errors = predictions - y
        gradient = (1/m) * X.T @ errors
        theta -= learning_rate * gradient
    
    return theta
```

## Mathematical Foundation

The update rule for gradient descent is:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \nabla_\theta J(\theta)$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $J(\theta)$ is our cost function
- $\nabla_\theta J(\theta)$ is the gradient

## Types of Gradient Descent

1. **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses entire dataset
2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Uses one sample at a time
3. **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Uses small batches

Each has trade-offs between computational efficiency and convergence stability.
